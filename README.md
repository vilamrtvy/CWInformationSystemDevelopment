# COURSE WORK - INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT

Course work on the topic "Development of a hospital information system".


After download database from folder "Database" import it in Workbench app. 

Folder "venv" for Python not added, so you need to add this folder on your computer. Necessary to configure Python Interpreter.

In my program use the following libraries:
1. Flask
2. PyMySql
3. Numpy

After - open the file "db.json" in folder "configs" and change password for your computer.


Access to the site is carried out through a login and password in database, table "Doctor". Use any combination to see the functionaly of site.

Good luck!
